# Autonomous-Exploration-and-Obstacle-Avoidance-TURTLEBOT3_MODEL-waffle_pi
For autonomous exploration, a structured 5 m × 5 m indoor Gazebo world was developed. Costmap parameters and DWA local planner settings were tuned to enhance obstacle detection and smooth motion. Integrated Gazebo, SLAM, Navigation, and RViz launches enabled accurate waypoint navigation to predefined corner targets.
